I have plotted four graphs:
1. Linear SVC
2. Polynomial SVC
3. Gaussian SVC
4. Sigmoid SVC

Each with Regularization parameter C = 1 and C = 10.

The plots show how decision boundaries change with a change in hyperparameters.

For Sigmoid kernel, the plot shows no decision boundary, since the dataset contains three classes and Sigmoid kernel is only for binary classification.

However, I changed the dataset to two classes for ploting Sigmoid kernel boundary, but still no classification is shown. I tried changing the hyperparameters like degree, coefficient0, regularization and gamma, but no boundary is seen for this data.
